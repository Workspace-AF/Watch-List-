# Watch-List-
This Watch-List app lets you save and organize movies you want to watch. You can add a movie with its title and genre, see all your saved movies in a clean list, delete any movie, and even pick a random one. The app has a simple design, easy buttons, and a helpful screen when the list is empty.
